# X Post Optimizer

Helps craft posts optimized for the X recommendation algorithm based on open-source algorithm analysis.

## How the Algorithm Scores Posts

The algorithm predicts **19 engagement actions** and combines them:

**Positive signals (boost reach):**
- Likes, Replies, Retweets, Quotes
- Dwell time (time spent reading)
- Profile clicks, Follows from post
- Shares (DM, copy link)
- Video quality views, Photo expands

**Negative signals (kill reach):**
- "Not interested" clicks
- Blocks, Mutes, Reports

## Instructions

When asked to optimize a post or write for X:

### 1. Hook First
- Lead with the most compelling point
- Stop the scroll in first 5 words
- Use pattern interrupts

### 2. Maximize Dwell Time
- Add depth that rewards reading
- Use line breaks for scanability
- Include images/videos that make people pause

### 3. Encourage Replies
- End with questions
- Make takes that invite discussion
- Leave threads open-ended

### 4. Avoid Author Penalty
The algorithm applies exponential decay to rapid posts from same author:
```
score = base_score × decay^(post_count)
```
**Recommendation:** Space posts 2-4 hours apart for maximum individual reach.

### 5. Leverage In-Network Advantage
Posts to followers rank higher than discovery posts. Build genuine following over chasing virality.

## Quick Checklist

When reviewing a draft post, check:

- [ ] Hook in first line?
- [ ] Rewards reading (dwell time)?
- [ ] Invites replies?
- [ ] No spam/repetitive content?
- [ ] Authentic voice (not engagement bait)?
- [ ] Appropriate timing from last post?

## What Doesn't Work

- Engagement pods (artificial patterns detected)
- Keyword stuffing (algorithm learns behavior, not keywords)
- Rapid-fire posting (author diversity penalty)
- Controversial content that triggers blocks/mutes

## Example Optimization

**Before:**
```
Just launched my new product! Check it out at example.com
```

**After:**
```
I spent 6 months building something I wish existed 3 years ago.

The problem: [specific pain point]
The solution: [what you built]

Here's what surprised me most about the process:

[insight that invites discussion]

What's been your experience with [related topic]?
```

**Why it's better:**
- Hook creates curiosity (dwell time)
- Structure rewards reading
- Ends with question (replies)
- Authentic story (avoids mute/block signals)
